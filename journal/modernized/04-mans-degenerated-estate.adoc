[#mans_estate, short="Concerning Man's Degenerated Estate"]
== A few words concerning man in his fallen degenerated estate from God, in which he has not power to keep the commands of God, nor his law, nor to do any work acceptable to him; but all his righteousness is as filthy rags.

All men by nature are the children of wrath, as it is written, Eph. 2:3,
fallen from God and his power, degenerate plants of a strange vine, Jer. 2:21,
daily bringing forth evil fruit, in which God has no delight; his heart is corrupted,
his mind is corrupted, and every part and member of his body,
from the crown of the head to the sole of his foot, full of wounds and bruises,
and putrefying sores, Isa. 1:6;
every imagination of his heart is only evil continually.

Gen. 8:21. So that he is a vessel altogether unfit for the Lord's use or service,
neither has the Lord any delight in him in that state, because he is a slave to satan,
led captive at his will, to dishonor his Maker in all his words and works:
so that all his undertakings and outgoings are to promote satan's kingdom.
He calls evil good, and good evil, puts light for darkness, and darkness for light,
and is void of understanding, as the beast that perishes.
He is altogether insensible of his Creator, and of his way, truth, and life,
because they are spiritually discerned; being wholly a stranger to the life of God,
and to the covenant of promise, and without God in the world,
in its ways and works of darkness; drawing iniquity with cords of vanity,
and drinking it in, as the ox drinks water, till he fill himself, and vomit it up again.

In this estate he is compared to a dog,
whose nature is to vomit up that which he greedily eats; and to a swine,
whose nature is to wallow in the mire, as most pleasing to his nature,
till he has fouled himself all over, that he is loathsome to behold.
Even such is man by nature, who wallows in sin and corruption,
till he be loathsome in the sight of the Lord, and fit for no service for him,
till he be washed again.

Therefore the Lord cried unto the house of Israel, Wash you and make you clean,
put away the evil of your doings, Isa. 1:16, and then come unto me, verse 18.

In this condition, man's wisdom is earthly, carnal, sensual, and devilish;
yet by this he would compass the heavenly mystery of eternity,
and dive into the secrets of the Almighty,
and set up a way of worship of God in his will, and establish a righteousness of his own,
and will pray, read, sing and perform many duties in a hot zeal,
though without understanding the knowledge of God his Creator.

In this state were the Jews,
who killed and persecuted the Lord of life in their darkness and unbelief,
in a righteousness of their own, which was as filthy rags,
and would not cover them from the wrath of the Almighty,
a just reward of all their ungodly deeds, unto whom Christ put forth many parables,
and said.
Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God, John 3:3. And,
except you be converted, and become as little children,
you shall in no wise enter the kingdom of God, Luke 18:17,
though they were whited over as whited walls, yet they were foul and corrupted,
blind and naked; therefore the woe was often pronounced against them,
for all their zeal and profession of Christ and the apostles' words.

Therefore, Oh natural man! whoever you be, whether professor or profane,
your profession and profaneness are alike, while you are unconverted, un regenerated,
and uncreated again into that image and nature which is from above,
which can do the will and work of God well-pleasing to him.
I preach not perfection to you, but repentance,
I do not say that you can keep the law of God,
for then I should lie to you and lie against the Truth also.
I do not press you to keep the commandments of God, for you will say it cannot be done.
But this I say to you, if you will be wise,
you must first become a fool that you may be wise; 1 Cor. 3:18,
but this you can hardly bear,
you are so puffed up in the pride of your heart in what you perform unto God,
though when you hast done all you can, you are an unprofitable servant, as it is written,
Luke 17:10, who is to have his portion with hypocrites,
where is weeping and gnashing of teeth forever, Matt. 25:30.

At your hand' God cannot have a sacrifice well pleasing to him;
if you give your first-born for your transgression,
or the fruit of your body for the sin of your soul,
it is but as the cutting off of a dog's neck, or offering of swine's blood,
while your heart is corrupted through the deceitfulness of sin.
This is that with which God has a controversy in you;
and with you he will not make peace, till this wall of partition be broken down,
for it was that which first made a separation between your father Adam and him,
which stands against all his seed and race after him;
and not all the offerings and oblations throughout the first covenant,
which stood in outward things, could ever make an atonement,
so as to bring Adam's stock into unity with his Creator.

Therefore this is my counsel and advice unto you, who are in the unconverted state,
alienated from God, and estranged in your mind from his covenant of life,
who hast any desires in you to return unto the Lord who made you,
that he may save you from the heat of his wrath forever: cease from your own words,
works and ways, and be not hasty to run, before your Maker lead you by the hand,
in the light of his Truth, wherewith Christ has lighted you, John 1:9,
which shines in your dark heart, 2 Cor. 4:6, so shall you not abide in darkness,
but shall receive the light of life, John 8:12.

Hearken unto his voice; who stands at your door and knocks,
and who would have you receive him into your heart, which is his throne,
upon which he must sit as King, if ever he receive you into protection with him.
There he must work the Father's will in you, which is to purify you throughout in body,
soul and spirit,
without which you can never be a vessel of honor to God
to set forth his praise and glory in the earth.
His righteousness he must work in you by his right hand, which must cover you forever;
and you must be crucified upon his cross from
all your own righteousness and unrighteousness,
which all spring from the seed of enmity, in which God had no delight,
before you know the peace of God, which passes all understanding,
to keep your heart and mind.
All this you will find true in the day of your visitation,
however the false prophets may persuade you to the contrary;
that will deceive you in the day of the Lord's fierce indignation,
when every one shall receive a reward according to his deeds.
This is a hard saying to you who are yet alive in the
fulness of delight and pleasure in the flesh,
to tell you of dying to your own righteousness and unrighteousness,
before you come to live to God.

This is a bitter cup to you, of which you must be willing to drink,
before you taste of the cup of blessing, which is the communion of the blood of Christ,
1 Cor. 10:16, You must suffer with him who died upon the cross,
before you know the virtue of his resurrection; you must put off the old man,
with his deeds, before you put on the new man,
Eph. 4:22-24. You must purge out the old leaven of uncleanness,
and the old bottle must be broken, before you keep a feast of unleavened bread,
1 Cor. 5:7.8., as a passover unto the Lord.

This is the footsteps of the flock,
in which you must walk before Christ's righteousness be' yours;
you must buy the Truth with the loss of all that is contrary to it,
if ever you truly purchase it, so as to be yours forever.
This is the word of the Lord God unto you, which must be fulfilled in. or upon you.
Let no man deceive you, through vain words of such as to tell you,
"`God looks upon you not as you really are in sin, but as you are in Christ.`"
Oh poor deluded wretch!
This is the deceiveableness of unrighteousness indeed,
which would make God as unrighteous as themselves,
to look upon man in Christ when he is not; but in sin and transgression.
Give not heed to such lying vanities, lest you forsake your own mercies forever.
For because of these things has come the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience,
Eph. 5:6. Col. 3:6.

"`He that says to the wicked, you are righteous, shall the nations curse,
and people abhor,`" Prov. 24:24. I say, God looks upon you as you are;
and he will not justify you in sin, nor hold you guiltless in transgression,
but "`will wound the head of his enemies,
and the hairy scalp of such a one as goes on still in
his trespasses,`" Ps. 68:21. Therefore return,
return unto the Lord by speedy repentance, and kiss the Son lest he be angry,
and you perish from the way of life; when his wrath be kindled but a little.
Blessed are all they that trust in him, Ps. 2:12.

I tell you again, I am not sent to preach perfection unto you,
but the day of the Lord's vengeance and recompense.
I am not to daub you with untempered mortar, as the false prophets have done many years,
to cry peace to you while in iniquity, to whom the Lord says,
"`There is no peace,`" Isa. 48:22; ch. 57:21. Therefore cease from man,
and from spending your money for that which is not bread,
and your labor for that which satisfies not, Isa. 55:2.

And if you are, or has been feeding among the swine upon the husk,
and wallowing in the mire among them,
and satisfying yourself with a profession of the saints' words outwardly;
as they are written in the letter of the Scripture,
while you are a stranger to that life in which they lived who gave them forth;
oh this is as chaff to the wheat,
which is the inward possession of the life and righteousness of the Son of God.
Therefore return unto your Father's house, to the light in which God dwells,
1 Tim. 6:16, so will he meet you, and embrace you, and rejoice over you,
and satisfy you with bread enough, Luke 15:17-20,
yes with the fatted calf (his own crucified one)
of which you shall feed and never hunger more.

This I was warned by the Lord to lay before all who are yet in Babylon and Egypt,
that they may flee out and escape from her sins, lest they partake of her plagues,
as it is written, Rev. 18:4, for the hour of her judgment is come,
and the execution will speedily follow,
which will leave the wicked neither root nor branch.

Therefore let your laughter be turned into mourning, and your joy into heaviness,
for God has clothed himself with a garment of vengeance, and with zeal, as with a cloak,
Isa. 49:17; and no unclean thing shall now stand before him.
Howl you oaks of Bashan, and you cedars of Lebanon,
the Lord has laid his axe to your roots, and your strength and tallness must come down.
Your fruit has been the fruit of Sodom, and your grapes the grapes of Gomorrah;
you have long cumbered the ground, even till it is weary with you,
and is ready to vomit you up; therefore bow yourselves unto the mighty God of Jacob,
before he cut you down, and cast you into the fire of his jealousy forever.
Tremble at the presence of him, whose word is gone forth.
He is the God of the whole earth, and before him all nations are as the drop of a bucket,
Isa. 40:15, who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand,
and meted out the heavens with a span,
and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales,
and the hills in a balance,
Isa. 40:12. He will render to every man according to the fruit of his doings;
therefore while you hast a little time, prize it,
lest the day of your visitation pass away,
and the day of wrath come upon you as a thief in the night, 1 Thess. 5:2.
