== Consideration of True and Acceptable Worship

The deep and weighty consideration of the true and
acceptable worship and service of Almighty God,
who is an unlimited spirit of life, light and glory, has been upon me from year to year,
since he first opened mine eyes to see and know
what was good and acceptable in his sight.
To wait diligently upon him, in the true silence of all flesh;
to know what is his good and perfect will, and with what to come before him,
and what offering is and has been acceptable to him, whether prayer, praises,
preaching or silence;
all or any of which being performed as he requires in a broken and contrite spirit,
trembling at his word; this both is, and ever was acceptable to him,
as he spake by that evangelical prophet Isaiah,
chap. 66:2. And all other service or sacrifice, though ever so glorious,
which is brought forth in the will and wit of man,
being never so finely polished with eloquent phrases,
is but as the cutting off a dog's neck, or offering swine's blood,
which is an abomination in the eye of the pure God.
His worship is not limited to day, time, or place, forms, words or names;
but is spiritual and only performed by them who
are given up to be led and guided by his Spirit,
in every duty which he requires of them.
These are the spiritual worshippers within the temple,
who offer up their hearts as a living sacrifice to God, in the flames of Divine love,
and who can wait upon him, in true poverty of spirit till he kindles the sacrifice.
This is the ancient gospel- worship which our
Lord and Savior taught the woman of Samaria,
John 4:23-24, and which he is now teaching his sons and daughters,
servants and handmaids, who are given up to wait upon Him, to know his Divine pleasure,
what he will require of them;
for that alone is acceptable to him which is of his own preparing;
therefore he gave Israel his good Spirit to direct them in his worship and service,
Neh. 9:20. And in the clear gospel-ministration,
his worship was not limited to Jerusalem, or the mount, or the temple,
or to any set form,
but the true worshippers are to worship the Father in spirit and truth,
for such he then sought, and is now seeking to worship him.

But oh! how far different are the several forms of worship in this land,
which are invented and brought forth in the will and wit of fallen man,
for private and sinister ends.
When they come together to offer, without any deliberation,
or waiting to know the good will and pleasure of God,
they speak a divination of their own brain-study,
giving to God just as much as they think fit, or have shaped into a form,
and he must accept of that, or nothing; and when so much is said over,
then worship is done.

How would a prince, or a potentate of the earth, be pleased that his servant,
upon all occasions, should rush into his presence, and immediately give that to him,
which he never required of him,
neither commanded him to prepare for him? Will not the master
judge it presumption in the servant thus to deal with him from
year to year? May not he rather justly say to the servant,
It is your duty to wait upon me, to know my pleasure,
and to offer to me what I command you;
and reject him and his offering? And shall not the just and righteous God,
reject all such offerings in this day, and say as once he did to Israel of old;
Isaiah the first, to the 20th, Who required these things at your hands.
And, Behold, all you that kindle a fire; that compass yourselves about with sparks;
walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks that you have kindled;
this shall you have of mine hand, you shall lie down in sorrow, Isa. 51:11.

And what are all your formal services and sermons,
collected together in the will and wisdom of man for money,
but sparks of your own kindling; and saying, Thus says the Lord,
when the Lord never spake to you--like the false prophets of Israel, Ezek.
13th. Oh! repent, repent; sit down in sackcloth and ashes;
let your laughter be turned into mourning, your feasts into fasting,
and your joy into heaviness.

For the Lord is arisen to search all professions upon the earth,
and woe to them who are covered, and not with the Spirit of the Lord,
for the day that is approaching, shall try every man's works,
whether they are wrought in God, by the motion of his Spirit, or not.

And now the skirts of the false church he will fully discover to her shame and confusion:
and her merchants he will bring more and more into contempt,
who have traded with slaves and souls of men, Rev.
18th, and through covetousness have made merchandize of the people for many ages, 2 Pet.
2: in this long and dark night of apostasy since the apostles days.
The hour of her judgment is come, and the Judge stands at the door; let all who fear God,
and are willing to obey his word, come out of her, and partake not with her in her sins,
lest you partake of her plagues.
From a lover of the souls of all men,
