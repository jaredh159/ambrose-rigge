== The Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ Witnessed Unto

The true and everlasting gospel, is glad tidings, namely, deliverance, redemption,
and reconciliation of all mankind to God again.
It is the power of God to salvation, to every one that believes Rom. 1:16,
in and by which Christ is manifested in mortal flesh,
to ransom mankind from the bondage of corruption into
the glorious liberty of the sons and daughters of God:
Rom. 8:21, perfectly fulfilling the prophecy of Isaiah concerning Christ:
Isa. 42:6-7, The Lord has called you in righteousness, and will hold your hand,
and will keep you, and give you for a covenant to the people,
and for a light to the Gentiles; to open the blind eyes,
and to bring out the prisoner from the prison, and them that sit in darkness,
out of the prison house.

The proclamation of this gospel, is, peace on earth, and good will to men, Isa. 9:7,
and 66:12, Luke 2:14, in our day, as in ancient days; wherein Christ,
the Prince of peace, is manifested in his spiritual appearance,
to destroy the works of the devil, and to be the same savior, deliverer, and redeemer,
as ever he was.
His gospel is the same in its divine property,
bringing forth the same fruits and effects in every soul, who believes and obeys it,
which the Holy Scriptures bore testimony of in ancient days,
that was then brought forth and effected by Christ, the power and wisdom of God,
in mankind, who received and gave up to follow him, the captain of their salvation.

Here is an end of all outward war, fightings and bloodshed; the Prince of our peace,
in his spiritual appearance and work, being not come to destroy men's lives,
but to save them; and to give his life a ransom for many: Matt. 20:28, Mark 10:45,
Luke 9:56.

So that the ancient prophecy of Isaiah is here again fulfilled.
The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock;
and to the serpent, dust shall be his meat:
they shall no more hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, says the Lord:
Isaiah 65:25.

All true gospel believers are come to be living
witnesses of the fulfilling of this in our day,
who are made to love enemies; and if they hunger, to feed them; and if thirsty,
to give them drink; according to the ancient gospel precept, and the command of Christ:
Matt. 5:44. And also his minister's exhortation to the Romans, Dearly beloved,
avenge not yourselves, but give place unto wrath; for it is written, vengeance is mine,
and I will repay it, says the Lord.
Therefore if your enemy is hungry, feed him, if he thirst, give him drink;
for in so doing, you shall heap coals of fire on his head: Rom. 12:19-20.

The true ministers of this gospel have their commission from God alone,
and are not made by the will and wisdom of man,
but by the revelation of Jesus Christ in them,
according to Paul's testimony to the Galatians; I certify you, brethren,
that the gospel which was preached of me, is not after man;
for I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it,
but by the revelation of Jesus Christ: Gal. 1:11-12.

These are commissioned of God, to turn people from darkness to light,
and from the power of satan, unto God; that they may receive forgiveness of sins,
and an inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith in Christ Jesus;
according to Paul's testimony before king Agrippa: Acts 26:18.

The fruit and effect of their ministry, is a holy life, and godly conduct,
which is of great price in the sight of God.
These have received freely, and do minister freely; coveting no man's silver, gold,
or apparel; neither are they lords and masters over God's heritage,
but examples of self denial to the flock; being servants to all for Christ's sake,
and minister in the ability that God gives, be it less or more.

These gather not to themselves, but to Christ, the great Shepherd and Shiloh,
sent of God, according to Jacob's prophecy before his death;
i.e. The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a law-giver from between his feet,
until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be: Gen. 49:10.

There is another grand fruit, which the true and everlasting gospel brings forth, namely,
love, which is the bond of perfectness: Col. 3:14. The marks of which are,
it suffers long, is kind, and envies not; vaunts not itself, is not puffed up,
nor behaves itself unseemly, seeks not its own, is not easily provoked, thinks no evil;
rejoices not in iniquity, but rejoices in the Truth; bears all things, hopes all things,
endures all things: 1 Cor.
13.

These virtues many are made living witnesses of,
by the appearing and springing of the true gospel day,
as they have given up in faithfulness to walk in it;
to them there is no occasion of stumbling; the sun is before them,
and they see no shadow or variableness in their habitation;
neither can darkness come in their way; but they walk in the light of the Lamb,
within the walls of God's salvation: Rev.
21.

All these, and many more blessed effects,
has the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ brought forth in many souls,
by his coming and most glorious manifestation, in this latter age of the world,
wherein all the prophecies of him from Moses, are fulfilled and fulfilling.
And many shall yet come to the brightness of his rising,
and shall shake off their night garments, and put on the armor of light;
and the knowledge of the power and glory of God shall be perfectly restored,
from the least to the greatest; and Christianity shall shine over the earth,
in its ancient beauty and glory,
which has been eclipsed in this long and dark night of apostasy,
wherein the true gospel has been hid for ages.

But the darkness is past, and the true light now shines.
Honor and everlasting praises ascend unto his name, who, in an acceptable day,
visited us. When we lay polluted in our blood, and no eye pitied us,
he had compassion on us, and said unto us, live; and his word quickened us,
and became a light to our feet, and guided them into the way of holiness,
which alone leads to everlasting life.

The false gospel,
(or another gospel than that the apostles preached,) which is sad tidings,
witnessed against.

This gospel, though it has many of the words of the true,
yet its fruits and effects are diametrically different:
for here is no freedom or deliverance from sin and corruption, till death comes;
as if that were its redeemer, and a winding sheet, its deliverer;
always till then slavery, and no freedom or victory: like a false,
evil and discouraging captain, who shows his soldiers a great enemy,
and bids them go to fight against him, but tells them before hand,
they shall never overcome him so long as they live on earth.
Neither do such show them how they shall come to the true captain,
who would put upon them his whole armor of light,
whereby they might be abilitated to quench all the fiery darts of their enemy,
and gain perfect victory over him, and be made more than conquerors,
so that thousands have given themselves over to be conquered; some after one manner,
and some after another.

Here has the unrighteous deception entered the sons and daughters of men for many ages,
since the true gospel-day was hid from them.

The trumpeters of the other gospel have given an uncertain sound,
so that few or none have prepared themselves to war with their soul's enemy,
but have given up themselves to be subjected by him at his will;
and so he led them captive into various lusts and vanities,
which have drowned many in perdition; so that the leprosy of sin,
has overspread the nations, till the earth is filled with violence,
and the dark corners thereof are full of the habitations of cruelty:
so that peace on earth, and good will to men, are much lost, and few lay it to heart.

The false church has long made the nations drunk with her wine,
and adulterated their hearts and minds from God,
and placed them in the earth and earthly vanities, and fading pleasures;
yet in this state will pretend to worship God, and give orders for set forms,
according to the times;
but extend no further than outward observations and bodily exercise, which profit little:
Luke 17:1,20 Tim.
4:8.

So that all their days such continue and remain unprofitable servants,
who have no promise but to be cast into outer darkness,
where are weeping and gnashing of teeth: Matt. 25:30.

O! let all deeply and weightily consider these things, and lay them to heart,
before it be too late, and repentance be hid from their eyes!
Which God grant, through Jesus Christ our Lord, Amen.
