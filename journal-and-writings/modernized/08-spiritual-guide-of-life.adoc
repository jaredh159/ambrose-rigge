[#spiritual_guide, short="The Spiritual Guide of Life"]
== The Spiritual Guide of Life, Offered and Tendered to All Mankind, Without Respect Of Persons, Age or Sex, to Direct Their Feet Into the Way of Peace. Or the Inward and Spiritual Grace of God Exalted as Man's Only Teacher.

It is the universal concern of all mankind upon the face of the whole earth,
to seek those things which belong to their eternal peace, happiness,
tranquillity and rest with God, when time in this world shall be no more.
Yet such are the wiles and cunning devices of
the serpent and adversary of man's felicity,
[who prevailed with Adam and Eve in the beginning to
break God's covenant of life made with them]
that he prevails with the generality of their posterity at this day, to slight,
disesteem and undervalue that which should bring their salvation,
and them to the knowledge of the way thereunto,
which is God's inward and spiritual grace,
which came to be manifested and known by the second Adam, Christ Jesus, John 1:17.

This is the root, substance, and life of all true religion in the world,
and without it there is none in the earth; for God has given it,
to bring salvation to the ends thereof,
and to be a perfect and sufficient teacher to all mankind,
2 Cor. 12:9. This was the saints' teacher in the
gospel administration which brought their salvation.
Tit. 2:11. And till the nations and people in general come
to hear and learn of this inward and spiritual teacher,
they can never be taught to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts,
nor to live soberly and righteously in this present world.
This is the Christ of God, spiritually manifested in mortal flesh,
to destroy the works of the devil, which who does not hear, receive, follow and obey,
can never receive power to become servants or sons of God;
but remain all their days in the gall of bitterness and bond of iniquity,
heaping up wrath against the day of wrath,
and the revelation of the righteous judgments of God,
and their religion and faith are vain and unprofitable.

Thus Christ being manifested, becomes the author of eternal salvation in all who believe,
and is that great mystery which has been hid from our forefathers for many generations.

Where he is received, heard and obeyed, he manifests his strength and power in the soul,
greater than the power and strength of the enemy, and binds the strong man,
who has long kept the hearts of many, and casts him out,
and sets up there his own throne,
and rules till he has put all his enemies under his feet;
and so becomes the hope of glory to the people.
Col. 1:27. And whosoever does not thus receive, hear and obey him,
nor give up thus to be governed by him, cannot be his disciples,
nor receive power from him, to become sons or servants of the living God.

Though they may profess his name in words,
and make a fair show of Christianity in the flesh,
yet the true Christian life they are strangers unto, and without God in the world,
dead in sins and trespasses, and can never be raised out of the grave of corruption,
but as they believe in, and wait for the manifestation of his power,
\[which is only known and manifested by his inward light and grace\]
to work all their works in them and for them.
Thus must man be made the workmanship of God,
created again in Christ Jesus unto good works, Eph. 2:10. This is the new creation,
where man receives the image of God, i.e., righteousness,
which was lost in the first Adam.
"`For as the body without the spirit is dead,
so faith without works is dead also,`" JAmos 2:17-20. For by works of righteousness,
brought forth in man by Christ, God's righteousness, is saving faith known.
And no man can have true faith in Christ,
who manifests not the works of righteousness in his conduct.

For the fruit and effect of saving faith in man, is an inward righteousness and holiness,
whereby man's heart, soul and spirit is sanctified to God,
without which no man can see God.
And man must follow him in the works of his righteousness, and learn of him,
and bear his cross--not one of gold, silver, wood or stone,
but that which crucifies their beloved lusts and pleasures,
without which they can never wear his crown.
For though man by his own power cannot work his own salvation,
yet as he believes in and follows Him whom God has given for a Leader, Isa. 55:4.,
and a Commander to his people,
he shall receive power from him to do whatsoever he commands him,
and be saved by him from his sin and transgression; for his name is called Jesus,
because he saves his people from their sins,
Matt. 1:21. And whosoever is not saved by him here from their sins,
can never be saved hereafter by him from the wrath and displeasure of Almighty God,
and that death which is the wages of sin, Rom. 6:28.

Now, the means which God has appointed to bring his salvation to all mankind,
is his inward and spiritual grace and truth which came by Christ Jesus,
John 1:17. This inward teacher as all mankind come to hear and obey,
they through him will be saved,
Eph. 2:8. He has virtue and power to bring forth righteousness in man,
and to work out all unrighteousness.

It is like a little leaven hid in the meal which Christ spoke of, Matt. 13:33,
and will leaven the whole lump of mankind into sincerity and truth,
if it be received and obeyed.
This is the precious pearl, hid in the field which is the world, set in man's heart,
EcclEst. 3:11, which the wise man digs deep there to find, Matt. 13:45-46,
and having found it,
sells and parts with all his lusts to purchase it. No man can buy it
but with the loss and denial of all things contrary to it;
gold will not purchase it, and silver is dross in comparison of it,
the price thereof is above rubies; and therefore the wise man said, "`Buy the truth,
and sell it not,`" Prov. 23:23. Rev. 3:18. No man can truly say,
"`My beloved is mine, and I am his,`" but as he thus buys it,
with the selling of all contrary to it. This is a hard saying to many,
or the most part of mankind, especially the rich, who have great possessions;
and many beloved lusts and pleasures to part withal,
which are as dear and near as their right hand or eye.

This made the young man, whom Christ spoke unto, Matt. 19:21-22,
to go away from him sorrowful, who had great possessions; upon which the Son of Man said,
"`That a rich man should hardly enter into the kingdom of God,`" verse 23.
And "`it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle,
than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven,`" verse 24.

Here is the mystery of godliness revealed, which the natural man cannot see, or perceive,
for it is hid from the wise and prudent of the world,
and discovered and revealed unto babes and little ones.
The great and proud men of the world are too big to enter the strait gate,
and walk in the narrow way;
the preaching of the cross of our Lord Jesus to them is foolishness,
\[and they cannot see the strait gate,\]
\[and the cross\]
which the apostles preached,
and all the true disciples and followers of Jesus Christ took up,
who were crucified to the world, and the world to them.
Gal. 6:14:

Therefore lay aside all your imaginary crosses of gold, silver, wood or stone,
they are of no value,
neither is there any virtue in them to crucify one lust that wars in your members; yes,
though you may carry them in your bosoms,
yet your beloved lusts lie there also unmortified, which every day war against the soul,
and so far prevail, that they bring forth sin in word and deed, which being' finished,
brings forth death, JamEst. 1:15.

The true cross of Christ is the power of God in all who believe, 1 Cor. 1:18. "`And,
having made peace through the blood of his cross,
by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say,
whether they be things in earth,
or things in heaven,`" Col. 1:20. That by which the
ancient Christians were crucified to the world,
and the world to them, was the cross of Christ spiritually borne.
Gal. 6:14.

But since the Christian life and spirit have been laid aside and quenched,
the knowledge of this cross has been lost, and people have set up an image of it,
and are become strangers and enemies to the cross of Christ,
as the Jews and pharisees were in the gospel day, being without God in the world.

The knowledge of the mystery of God's salvation to all mankind upon the earth,
must be opened and manifested by the gift of God, that is, by his grace and spirit,
as it is received and obeyed, "`For as no man knows the things of a man,
save the spirit of a man within him: even so the things of God knows no man,
but the spirit of God,`" 1 Cor. 2:11. With this
spirit within did the prophet Isaiah seek the Lord,
Isaiah 26:9. And with the Spirit of Truth within must all mankind seek the Lord,
if ever they find him and know his work;
for without it the knowledge of God's salvation is, and forever will be,
hid from the wise and prudent of the world.
This was the Jews' blindness, the resisting of the spiritual gift of God, Acts 7:51,
who by their wicked hands stoned Stephen to death,
though they held up the temple worship, the offerings and sacrifices,
yet by resisting the spirit of God in themselves,
they became more blind than he who had an unclean spirit who said to Christ,
"`I know you who you are, the Holy One of God,`" Mark 1:23-24. Matt. 8:29. Yes,
the devil confessed him to be the Son of God, Mark 5:7.

The grand cause of all the error in the world,
is in going from the Spirit of Truth within, the Comforter now sent,
according to the promise of Christ, John 14:16,17,26.

This Comforter being received, heard and obeyed, leads into all truth,
and is a perfect guide appointed of God for all mankind,
to bring to the knowledge of God's salvation; and thus to know the only true God,
and Jesus Christ whom he has sent, is eternal life; and all knowledge short hereof,
is earthly and carnal.

Christ within, the hope of glory, has been as a mystery hid from ages and generations,
but revealed in the gospel day.
Col. 1:26-27.

And thus manifested to the gentiles, Acts 13;47,
that he might be God's salvation to the ends of the earth;
when the wise professing Jews rejected him in his outward appearance in the flesh,
to whom he was first tendered.

This inward and spiritual appearance of the Christ of God in our day,
the chief priests and literal and worldly wise
professing Christians do oppose and gainsay,
and will not have him thus to rule in the hearts and consciences of his people;
but call the true light, which is his life and spiritual appearance, John 1:4,
a dark lantern, and a natural conscience;
and so make the word and commandment of none effect by their traditional religion,,
which is set up in the will and wit of man,
and do every day crucify to themselves afresh the Lord of glory,
and put him to open shame; for every wicked word and deed is as a spear to wound him.

And no man can be a true Christian, who is not baptized into the death of Christ,
Rom. 6:3, that is, dead to sin; this is the true spiritual baptism,
of which John's baptism with water was but a figure, type, and forerunner.
Neither is he now a gospel Christian, who is one outward; neither is that baptism,
that is outward in the flesh; but he is a true Christian, who is one inward,
and the one baptism is that of the heart and of the spirit.
For neither baptism, nor unbaptism, as outward, avails anything, but a new creature,
created again in Christ Jesus unto good works to live in them,
Eph. 2:10. This is Christianity in its ancient glory and purity,
which is restored and witnessed by receiving, hearing,
and obeying the inward and spiritual "`grace of God which brings salvation,`"
Tit. 2:11. Of which water baptism is an outward and visible sign,
as it is declared in the book of common prayer now used in England, where they say,
"`That the inward and spiritual grace is a death unto sin,
and a new birth unto righteousness,`" etc.
And till the outward Christians come to hear and obey this inward and spiritual grace,
they cannot know or witness God's salvation;
for all without it is but as a shell and shadow, and as chatF to the wheat.

And as Christ's appearance and manifestation in the substance of the gospel ministration,
is inward and spiritual, so is his baptism, and so is his supper, and all his ordinances,
and all who truly "`eat his flesh, and drink his blood, dwell in him,
and he in them,`" John 6:56.

For it is the spirit that quickens all who are made alive by him,
the flesh profits nothing, verse 63. The words he spake were spirit and life,
though mysteriously spoken; at which the Jews murmured,
and many of the disciples were offended, verses 52, 60, 61, and looked outward,
as too many do in our day, who neither discern his flesh nor blood,
and so eat and drink their own damnation.
Though the children of Israel ate manna in the
wilderness that was rained down from heaven every day,
yet as it was outward, they died, John 6:49. Therefore it is not the outward bread,
in the gospel dispensation, that nourishes the soul to eternal life,
but the spiritual manna, which is received by the indwelling of the Son of God in man,
and man dwelling in him, verses 56, 57. They who thus eat his flesh and drink his blood,
have eternal life, and he will raise them up at the last day,
verse 54. This is the anti-type, or mystery of all outward types and representations,
even the cup of the New Testament in his blood, in all who spiritually receive it;
for the outward flesh, bread and cup profit nothing as to the soul's nourishment;
it is the spiritual, that gives life,
the bread and cup thereof nourishes up to eternal life.
Where Christ is come and risen in the spirit,
his spiritual bread and cup shows his resurrection in the soul.
Here those who are quickened and raised by him,
live by every word that proceeds out of his mouth,
Matt. 4:4. And being thus made partakers of his resurrection,
over them the second death has no power.
This was represented by Moses lifting up the serpent in the Wilderness, John iii, 14,
Num. 21:9; so must the Son of Man be lifted up in the soul,
that all who are bitten by the spiritual serpent, may look to him, and be healed.
For though he was made a sacrifice to God for the sins of the whole world,
that through his life and resurrection the whole world might be saved,
yet has no man part in him, or his resurrection,
who is not in this world washed from his uncleanness by him.
For the purging, which all true Christian believers own, is by the blood of Jesus Christ,
to cleanse them from their sins, which none can have the benefit of,
but those who walk in the light,
1 John 7:17. "`For if we say we have fellowship with God, and walk in darkness, we lie,
and do not the truth,`" verse 6. "`But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light,
we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ, his Son,
cleanses us from all sin.`"
Here is the covenant in which the benefit, virtue,
and efficacy of the blood of Jesus is known and witnessed to this day,
and must be throughout all generations.
Therefore has the true light, or grace of God,
lighted every man that comes into the world, John 1:9, that all might receive it,
and walk in it and so be made living witnesses of the
blood of Jesus Christ to cleanse them from their sins.

If the sons and daughters of men had come to know this,
they need not to have imagined an outward purgatory to cleanse people from their sins;
the blood of Jesus thus known and witnessed is
sufficient to sanctify and make clean in body,
soul and spirit, all who walk in the light;
and thus would God's salvation be known and manifested to the ends of the earth.
For as the lightning comes out of the east, and shines to the west,
so is the shining of the Sun of righteousness in the soul of man.
But till the day dawn and the day-star arise in the heart,
the glorious Sun of righteousness with healing in his wings can never be known to arise;
and until this is known and witnessed, all preaching is vain, and people's faith is vain,
and they are still in their sins, and can never be made partakers of his resurrection,
nor conformable to his death, but live and die in their sins,
and where he goes they cannot come, John 8:2], 24.

Therefore let all be warned,
to take heed to the true light and inward spiritual grace of God,
and give up to the teachings thereof, that they may receive an understanding from God,
to know the mysteries of the kingdom of righteousness,
which are hid from the wise and prudent of the world, who are glorying in brain-study,
human arts and literature, and natural acquirements in the will and wisdom of man.

Through these was divine wisdom never conveyed to any of the sons of men.
True wisdom is the gift of God, communicated to them who love and fear him;
the secrets of the Lord are daily manifested to such,
and they lack not the knowledge of the mysteries of the kingdom of righteousness,
but can declare to others what God has done for their souls,
of what they have tasted and handled of the word of eternal life;
these are able ministers of the New Testament, not of the letter, but of the spirit.

And till the nations and people in general be turned unto, and receive the gift of God,
which he has universally given to all mankind to profit withal,
they can never see the opening of eternal life;
neither can the way thereof be manifested or known by anything short of it;
neither can any man know life by it till he is subjected to it,
and spiritually baptized by it into the death of Christ;
this is the true inward Christian, whose praise is not of men, but of God.
For the true Christian baptism is a death unto sin, and a new birth unto righteousness,
and none are Christians indeed but who are so baptized.
Upon this account said the Son of God unto Nicodemus, "`Except a man be born again,
he cannot see the kingdom of God,`" John 3:3. And again,
"`Except a man be born of water, and of the spirit,
he cannot enter into the kingdom of God,`" verse 5, the spiritual water,
wherewith the Holy Ghost does wash all true believers,
and bring them into newness of life.
For he is not a Christian that is one outward; neither is that baptism,
that is outward in the flesh; but he is a Christian who is one inward,
and baptism is that of the heart, and in the spirit.
This is the true gospel ministration,
the last and greatest that ever the world shall be visited withal.

This has a more excellent glory, than that which stood in meats and drinks,
and carnal ordinances and commandments of men,
and therefore is to remain to all generations, 2 Cor.3:6-11.

Now all you who are set down in outward visible signs,
and are slighting and neglecting the substance, that is,
the inward and spiritual grace which must bring your salvation,
the enemy has deceived you in keeping you from receiving, hearing, and obeying it,
your sufficient teacher and bringer of salvation.
Thus you are ever learning,
and can never come to the knowledge of the Spirit of Truth in yourselves,
which is given of God to lead you into all truth, John 16:13,
the Comforter promised by Christ, John 14:16-17, to abide forever;
who he said dwelt with his disciples, and should be in them, verse 17. This Comforter,
the Spirit of Truth is arisen in our day,
and is manifested in all true believers for this purpose,
to destroy the works of the devil.

But oh! let the outward Christians beware, lest they reject him in his inward appearance,
as the outward Jews rejected him in his outward appearance;
for if they wound and crucify the Spirit of Truth, and of Christ in themselves,
they will be as guilty of his blood, as were the Jews of old.
What slighting, despising, no,
blaspheming against this inward and spiritual appearance of Christ have the
nominal Christians been guilty of these forty years? How have they buffeted,
stoned and imprisoned him in his servants, for speaking through them'? No,
they have crucified him afresh, and put him to open shame by their ungodly deeds,
and hard speeches.

Oh Lord!
I pray you open their eyes,
that they may see him whom they have thus pierced with their sharp spears,
and let a day of mourning and lamentation come over them,
as was prophesied of the house of David, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
every family apart, and their wives apart,
Zech. 12:10-14. He is indeed a Comforter to such mourners now,
but cries woe to them who now laugh,
as he did in the days of his flesh to the Jews and Pharisees,
Luke 6:25. For outward Christianity now, where the inward life,
spirit and power ofChrist are not received and witnessed,
is of no more value in the sight of God, than were the Jews offerings and sacrifices,
when they were inwardly polluted.
For it is the sacrifice of a broken heart and contrite spirit, which the Lord regards,
Ps. 51:17, and the inward white linen is beautiful in his eye,
and his sons and daughters are all glorious within.
Ps. 45:13. They hunger and thirst after an inward righteousness,
i.e. the righteousness of faith, which says, go not forth, Matt. 24:26.

Rom. 10:8, for the word is nigh you in your heart,
and in your mouth that you may hear it,
and do it. This was the word of faith which the true gospel-ministers preached,
believed and received; and who does not receive this inward word,
cannot know the salvation of God,
for it is the engrafted word that is able to save the soul,
JamEst. 1:21. And till the people come to hear and to do this word,
their buildings are upon the sand, and will not stand in a stormy day;
for true and saving faith is obtained and received by hearing this word,
in all who live and stand in it, without which no man can please God,
Heb. 11:6. Thus the ancients received faith, and walked in it,
and did many valiant acts, both in the time of the first and second covenant,
and had victory over the world; yes, they were made more than conquerors over death,
hell and the grave, Rom. 8:37, and obtained a good report,
though they received not the promise, Heb. 11:39.

And now this testimony I must leave to the world,
that God has sent his good Spirit into the hearts of the children of men,
to be their guide, leader and director in all things relating to his kingdom;
and upon the receiving and obeying, or resisting and disobeying this Spirit,
stands man's eternal felicity or woe,
for nothing short of it can give mankind the
knowledge of the mysteries of God's salvation;
and all knowledge without it, is earthly and carnal, and can never give life to the soul.

And therefore all you outside Christians, professors and profane,
who have taken up your rest in an outward profession of God and godliness,
but live in the profane fashions, customs and superfluities of the world,
far beyond those you term heathens, my soul is often bowed down for you,
because you are resisting the appearance of God's Spirit, as did the Jews of old.
Through your traditional religion,
which you have received by and from your darkened and benighted ancestors,
you have made the word and commandment of God of none effect,
and have wrought despite against the Spirit of Grace,
and have set down at ease in an outside invented form of godliness,
imitating some things which the holy men of God did in the days of old,
through the leading and dictates of God's Spirit.
But this to you is but an image or likeness of a thing in heaven;
and it may be said to you, as it was to Judah in the days of Isaiah the prophet,
Who has required these things at your hands? Isa. 1:12. Your set days and fasts,
your morning and evening sacrifices, the Lord has no regard unto, but says at this day,
as in days past, Isa. 1:16-17. Jer. 4:14, Wash your hearts from wickedness;
the fountain is open,
put away the pride and abominations of the heathen out of your houses and hearts,
and boast not yourselves that you are not as other men; peradventure no common drunkards,
swearers, nor extortioners, nor thieves, nor murderers,
but that you pay the tithe of all you possess, give alms, and often have family duties,
and frequent the church and its ordinances, as you call them.

All this, and much more, if you had it, will not give you acceptance with God,
while your inside is full of rottenness and corruption;
this righteousness exceeds not that of the Scribes and Pharisees,
but is many degrees short thereof.

Arise, arise, this is not your rest, because it is polluted,
Mic. 2:10. Shake off your night garments, be afflicted and mourn, and weep,
let your laughter be turned into mourning, and your joy into heaviness;
for the Lord is arisen to plead with all flesh, by his sword, and by fire,
and he will leave the- outward court to be trodden down of the Gentiles.
He is arisen in his fury as a man of war,
and is disquieting the nations with wars and commotions,
and causing the potsherds of the earth to dash one another to pieces,
that he may make way and room for his own kingdom, rule and government in the earth;
and all who will not that he should rule, he will slay by the breath of his mouth,
and the brightness of his coming.

For Babylon must fall among Papists and Protestants, even that which has been builded up,
whereby to reach to heaven, in the will and wisdom of man:
for it is come in remembrance before the Lord, and great will be the fall thereof;
her merchants shall lament to see her destruction,
when they shall not be able to relieve her.
And the scattered flock of the house of Jacob, God will gather into his own fold,
that is, his power, within whose walls is the well of life,
where all the sheep of his pasture drink,
and here shall none be able to make them afraid,
for the power of God is that universal fold,
into which the gathering of the nations must be. All
who gather not into this power are false shepherds,
and gather to themselves for unrighteous gain;
but the gathering of the people shall be to the Lord, Gen. 49:10,
Israel's true Shepherd and leader;
so shall the kingdoms of the world become the kingdoms of God and his Son.

This testimony lay upon me to leave behind to the world,
not knowing how long my days may be therein.
